## Franklin — AI Agent with a Wallet

> **The first Autonomous Economic Agent.** Franklin doesn't just write text — it autonomously spends USDC from a user-funded wallet to execute real work: marketing campaigns, trading signals, content generation.

**Built on three layers:**

1. **x402 micropayment protocol** — HTTP 402 native payments. Every API call is a payment. No billing dashboards, no API keys — just pay-per-request over HTTP.
2. **BlockRun Gateway** — aggregates <!-- br:models.chatVisible -->66<!-- /br:models.chatVisible --> LLMs + paid APIs (Exa, DALL-E, future Runway/Suno/CoinGecko) behind a single x402 endpoint.
3. **Franklin Agent** — the reference client. An AI agent that actually spends money to get things done.

**Three verticals, one wallet:**

| Vertical | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Marketing Agent** | Campaigns, social outreach, lead gen — autonomously pays for web search, research APIs, copywriting models |
| **Trading Agent** | Signals, research, risk analysis — autonomously pays for market data, LLM reasoning, on-chain queries |
| **Content Agent** | ImageGen, VideoGen, budget-tracked media production — autonomously pays per asset (DALL-E, Flux, future Runway/Suno) |

**Why Franklin belongs in this list:**

- It's the **only agent that natively spends crypto** to complete tasks — not a simulation, not a demo, real USDC on Base
- **x402 protocol** makes every API call a micropayment — no subscriptions, no API keys, just pay-per-request
- **Smart model routing** — plans with premium models, executes with cheap ones, saving 5-10x on LLM costs
- **Self-learning** — tracks which models/tools deliver the best results per task type and optimizes automatically
- **Plugin system** — extensible with social, marketing, and custom plugins
- **MCP integration** — auto-discovers and uses Model Context Protocol servers for additional tools

**Quick start:**

```bash
npm install -g @blockrun/franklin
franklin  # launch the agent
```
